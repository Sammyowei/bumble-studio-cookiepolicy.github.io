    <h1>Bumble Studio - Cookie Policy</h1>
    <p style="color: darkturquoise;">Last Update: nov 19th, 2022</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Policy informs You about the technologies that help this Application to achieve the purposes described
        below. Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use
        resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with this Application.</p>
    <p>For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this Policy – unless there is a reason to
        differentiate. For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to
        talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within
        this Policy, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of
        Tracker.</p>
    <p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent. Whenever consent is given,
        it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this Policy.</p>
    <p>This Application uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that
        enable services provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within
        this Policy, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.</p>
    <p>The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set
        by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.</p>
    <p>In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, You may find more
        precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information –
        such as the presence of other Trackers - in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers
        or by contacting the Owner.</p>
    <p>To find more information dedicated to Californian consumers and their privacy rights, You may read the privacy
        policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Avtivities strictly necessary for the operation of our Application and delivery of our Service</h2>
    <p>This Application uses so-called “technical” Cookies and other similar Trackers to carry out activities that are
        strictly necessary for the operation or delivery of the Service.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>3. Other Activities ivolving the use of trackers</h2>
    <h3 style="color: darkturquoise;">Targeting & Advertising</h3>
    <p>This Application uses Trackers to deliver personalized marketing content based on User behavior and to operate,
        serve and track ads.</p>
    <p>The advertising service allows User Data to be utilized for advertising communication purposes. These
        communications are displayed in the form of banners and other advertisements on this Application, possibly based
        on User interests.</p>
    <p>This does not mean that all Personal Data are used for this purpose. Information and conditions of use are shown
        below.</p>
    <p>Some of the services listed below may use Trackers to identify You or they may use the behavioral retargeting
        technique, i.e. displaying ads tailored to the User’s interests and behavior, including those detected outside
        this Application. For more information, please check the privacy policies of the relevant services.</p>
    <p>Services of this kind usually offer the possibility to opt out of such tracking. In addition to any opt-out
        feature offered by any of the services below, You may learn more on how to generally opt out of interest-based
        advertising within the dedicated section "How to opt-out of interest-based advertising" in this Policy.</p>

    <h2>4. How to manage preferences and provide or withdraw consent</h2>
    <p>There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and to provide and withdraw consent, where relevant:
    </p>
    <p>You can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by
        preventing the use or storage of Trackers.</p>
    <p>Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, You can provide or withdraw such consent by
        setting their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant
        consent-preferences widget, if available.</p>
    <p>It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including
        those used to remember the User’s initial consent.</p>
    <p>Other Trackers in the browser’s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.</p>
    <p>With regard to any third-party Trackers, You can manage their preferences and withdraw their consent via the
        related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by
        contacting the third party.</p>
    <p style="color: darkturquoise;">Locating Tracker Settings</p>
    <p>You can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the
        following addresses:</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Chrome</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Apple Safari</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Brave</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Opera</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>You may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device
        settings such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (You may
        open the device settings and look for the relevant setting).</p>

    <h3 style="color: darkturquoise;">How to opt out of interest-based advertising</h3>
    <p>Notwithstanding the above, You may follow the instructions provided by YourOnlineChoices
        (https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) (EU), the Network Advertising Initiative
        (https://thenai.org/about-online-advertising/) (US) and the Digital Advertising Alliance
        (https://scan-master-ios.web.app/scanmasterprivacy_policy.html) (US), DAAC (https://youradchoices.ca/en/learn)
        (Canada), DDAI (http://www.ddai.info/optout) (Japan) or other similar services. Such initiatives allow You to
        select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools. The Owner thus recommends that You make use
        of these resources in addition to the information provided in this Policy.</p>

    <p>The Digital Advertising Alliance offers an application called AppChoices
        (https://youradchoices.com/.well-known/captcha/) that helps You to control interest-based advertising on mobile
        apps.</p>
